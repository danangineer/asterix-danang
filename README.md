# Asterix-Danang

This repository is meant to be a template for building your own custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image. This template is the recommended way to make customizations to any image published by the Universal Blue Project.

# Community

If you have questions about this template after following the instructions, try the following spaces:
- [Universal Blue Forums](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/)
- [Universal Blue Discord](https://discord.gg/WEu6BdFEtp)
- [bootc discussion forums](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/discussions) - This is not an Universal Blue managed space, but is an excellent resource if you run into issues with building bootc images.

# How to Use

To get started on your first bootc image, simply read and follow the steps in the next few headings.
If you prefer instructions in video form, TesterTech created an excellent tutorial, embedded below.

The signing key will be used in GitHub Actions and will not work if it is password protected.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful to *never* accidentally commit `cosign.key` into your git repo. If this key goes out to the public, the security of your repository is compromised.

Next, you need to add the key to GitHub. This makes use of GitHub's secret signing system.

    <summary>Using the Github Web Interface (preferred)</summary>

Go to your repository settings, under `Secrets and Variables` -> `Actions`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/216735595-0ecf1b66-b9ee-439e-87d7-c8cc43c2110a.png)
Add a new secret and name it `SIGNING_SECRET`, then paste the contents of `cosign.key` into the secret and save it. Make sure it's the .key file and not the .pub file. Once done, it should look like this:

<summary>Using the Github CLI</summary>

If you have the `github-cli` installed, run:

```bash
gh secret set SIGNING_SECRET < cosign.key
```

### Step 2b: Choosing Your Base Image


- Aurora: `ghcr.io/ublue-os/aurora:latest`

You can find more Universal Blue images on the [packages page](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages).

## Step 3: Switch to Your Image

From your bootc system, run the following command substituting in your Github username and image name where noted.
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/<username>/asterix-danang
```
This should queue your image for the next reboot, which you can do immediately after the command finishes. You have officially set up your custom image! See the following section for an explanation of the important parts of the template for customization.

# Repository Contents

## Containerfile

The [Containerfile](./Containerfile) defines the operations used to customize the selected image.This file is the entrypoint for your image build, and works exactly like a regular podman Containerfile. For reference, please see the [Podman Documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html).

## build.sh

The [build.sh](./build_files/build.sh) file is called from your Containerfile. It is the best place to install new packages or make any other customization to your system. There are customization examples contained within it for your perusal.

## build.yml

The [build.yml](./.github/workflows/build.yml) Github Actions workflow creates your custom OCI image and publishes it to the Github Container Registry (GHCR). By default, the image name will match the Github repository name. There are several environment variables at the start of the workflow which may be of interest to change.

# Artifacthub

This template comes with the necessary tooling to index your image on [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io). Use the `artifacthub-repo.yml` file at the root to verify yourself as the publisher. This is important to you for a few reasons:

- The value of artifacthub is it's one place for people to index their custom images, and since we depend on each other to learn, it helps grow the community. 
- You get to see your pet project listed with the other cool projects in Cloud Native.
- Since the site puts your README front and center, it's a good way to learn how to write a good README, learn some marketing, finding your audience, etc.

# Justfile Documentation

The `Justfile` contains various commands and configurations for building and managing container images and virtual machine images using Podman and other utilities.
To use it, you must have installed [just](https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html) from your package manager or manually. It is available by default on all Universal Blue images.

## Environment Variables

- `image_name`: The name of the image (default: "image-template").
- `default_tag`: The default tag for the image (default: "latest").
- `bib_image`: The Bootc Image Builder (BIB) image (default: "quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder:latest").

## Additional resources

For additional driver support, ublue maintains a set of scripts and container images available at [ublue-akmod](https://github.com/ublue-os/akmods). These images include the necessary scripts to install multiple kernel drivers within the container (Nvidia, OpenRazer, Framework...). The documentation provides guidance on how to properly integrate these drivers into your container image.

## Community Examples

These are images derived from this template (or similar enough to this template). Reference them when building your image!
